    <p class="subhead">HUMANISM AND THE BODY</p>
    <p>In fifteenth-century Italy, humanist writers and scholars rejected gothic scripts in favor of the lettera antica, a classical mode of handwriting with wider, more open forms. The preference for lettera antica was part of the Renaissance (rebirth) of classical art and literature. Nicolas Jenson, a Frenchman who had learned to print in Germany, established an influential printing firm in Venice around 1469. His typefaces merged the gothic traditions he had known in France and Germany with the Italian taste for rounder, lighter forms. They are considered among the first—and finest—roman typefaces.</p>
    <p>Many fonts we use today, including Garamond, Bembo, Palatino, and Jenson, are named for printers who worked in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. These typefaces are generally known as “humanist.”Contemporary revivals of historical fonts are designed to conform with modern technologies and current demands for sharpness and uniformity. Each revival responds to—or reacts against—the production methods, printing styles, and artistic habits of its own time. Some revivals are based on metal types, punches, or drawings that still exist; most rely solely on printed specimens.
    </p>
    <p>Italic letters, also introduced in fifteenth-century Italy (as their name suggests), were modeled on a more casual style of handwriting. While the upright humanist scripts appeared in prestigious, expensively produced books, the cursive form was used by the cheaper writing shops, where it could be written more rapidly than the carefully formed lettera antica. Aldus Manutius was a Venetian printer, publisher, and scholar who used italic typefaces in his internationally distributed series of small, inexpensive books. The cursive form saved money because it saved space. Aldus Manutius’s books often paired cursive letters with roman capitals; the two styles still were considered fundamentally distinct.
    </p>
    <p>In the sixteenth century, printers began integrating roman and italic forms into type families with matching weights and x-heights (the height of the main body of the lowerface letter). Today, the italic style in most fonts is not simply a slanted version of the roman; it incorporates the curves, angles, and narrower proportions associated with cursive forms.</p>
    <p class="subhead">ENLIGHTENMENT AND ABSTRACTION</p>
    <p>Renaissance artists sought standards of proportion in the idealized human body. The French designer and typographer Geofroy Tory published a series of diagrams in 1529 that linked the anatomy of leters to the anatomy of man. A new approach--distanced from the body--would unfold in the age of scientific and philosophical Enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>A committee appointed by Louis XIV in France in 1693 set out to construct roman letters against a finely meshed grid. Whereas Geofroy Tory's diagrams were produced as woodcuts, the gridded depictions of the romain du roi (king's alphabet) were engraved, made by incising a copper plate with a tool called a graver. The lead typefaces derived from these large-scale diagrams reflect the linear character of engraving as well as the scientific attitude of the king's committee.</p>
    <p>Engraved letters—whose fluid lines are unconstrained by letter-press’s mechanical grid—offered an apt medium for formal lettering. Engraved reproductions of penmanship disseminated the work of the great eighteenth-century writing masters. Books such as George Bickham's The Universal Penman (1743) featured roman letters—each engraved as a unique character—as well as lavishly curved scripts.
    </p>
    <p>Eighteenth-century typography was influenced by new styles of handwriting and their engraved reproductions. Printers like William Caslon in the 1720s and John Baskerville in the 1750s abandoned the rigid nib of humanism for the flexible steel pen and the pointed quill, instruments that rendered a fluid, swelling path. Baskerville, himself a master calligrapher, would have admired the thinly sculpted lines that appeared in the engraved writing books. He created typefaces of such sharpness and contrast that contemporaries accused him of “"blinding al the Readers in the Nation; for the strokes of your letters, being too thin and narrow, hurt the Eye."</p>
    <p>To heighten the startling precision of his pages, Baskerville made his own inks and hot-pressed his pages after printing.The severe vocabulary ofBaskerville was carried to an extreme by Giambattista Bodoni in Italy and Firmin Didot in France at the turn of the nineteenth century. Their typefaces- which have a wholly vertical axis, extreme contrast between thick and thin, and crisp, waferlike serifs--were the gateway to a new vision of typography unhinged from calligraphy.

    <p class="subhead">FREE ADVICE</p>
    <p>Think more, design less.</p>
    <p>Many desperate acts of design (including gradients, drop shadows, and the gratuitous use of transparency) are perpetrated in the absence of a strong concept. A good idea provides a framework for design decisions, guiding the work.</p>
    <p>Say more, write less.</p>
    <p>Just as designers should avoid filling up space with arbitrary visual effects, writers should remember that no one loves their words as much as they do.</p>
    <p>Spend more, buy less.</p>
    <p>Cheap stuff is usually cheap because of how it’s made, what it's made of, and who made it. Buy better quality goods, less often.</p>
    <p>May your thoughts be deep and your wounds be shallow.</p>
    <p>Always work with a sharp blade. Although graphic design is not a terribly dangerous occupation, many late-night accidents occur involving dull X-Acto blades. Protect your printouts from senseless bloodshed.</p>
    <p>Density is the new white space.</p>
    <p>In an era of exurban sprawl, closely knit neighborhoods have renewed appeal. So, too, on page and screen, where a rich texture of information can function better than sparseness and isolation.</p>
    <p>Make the shoe fit, not the foot.</p>
    <p>Rather than force content into rigid containers, create systems that are flexible and responsive to the material they are intended to accommodate.</p>
    <p>Make it bigger. (Courtesy of Paula Scher)</p>
    <p>Amateur typographers make their type too big. The 12-point default which looks okay
      on the screen—often looks horsey on the page. Experienced designers, however, make their type too tiny.</p>
