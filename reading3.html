                however, the meaning a colour may have can be very different. There are conflicting theories on whether the
                cultural meanings of colours can be categorised. Meanings can change over time and depend on the context.
                Black may be the colour of mourning in many countries, though a black book cover or a black poster is not
                always associated with death. Another example is that brides in China traditionally wear red, but many brides
                have started to wear white in recent decades.4 The cultural meaning of colours is not set but always changing.
                The next few pages list some of the meanings of colours in different cultures.

                  was the colour of mourning during the Roman empire, and in Judaism and Christianity it is associated with
                  death and evil. During the Middle Ages, black clothing became popular, and during the Renaissance it was
                  worn by the wealthy and nobility in all parts of Europe. In the nineteenth century, the black army was the
                  nickname of the Russian anarchists. In the twentieth century, black became the colour of Italian and German
                  fascism, who were called blackshirts. In Shia Islam black is a very devout colour. The black standard is one
                  of the flags of Muhammad in Islam. The black standard has been appropriated as a symbol by jihadism since
                  the late 1990s.

                  is the colour of death and mourning in China, Vietnam, and Korea. In India, people wear white after the
                  death of a family member. Jewish, Christian and Hindu religions use the colour white in rituals to indicate
                  purity, chastity, virginity, and peace. White is the traditional colour of bridal dresses in Western
                  cultures. In Europe, white was historically associated with absolute monarchy. It became synonymous in the
                  twentieth century with anti-communist and counter-revolutionary movements in Russia. A white dove is an
                  international sign of peace, and a white flag is the international sign of surrender.

                  as ambulances, road maintenance equipment, and taxis. In East Asia, yellow is considered sacred and

                  household were permitted to wear yellow. In China it is still seen as the colour of happiness, glory,
                  wisdom, harmony, and culture. Yellow is used to symbolise gold as one of the colours of the Catholic church
                  and the Vatican. Yellow in Italian is giallo and a nickname for crime stories. The demonstrations in the
                  Philippines in 1986 were also known as the yellow revolution.
